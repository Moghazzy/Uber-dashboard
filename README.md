ðŸš• Uber Trip Analysis Dashboard Completed! ðŸš•

Iâ€™m excited to share the results of my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Uber dataset. I analyzed key trends in trip purposes, mileage, and ride durations, focusing on both business and personal trips.

Key Insights:
Analyzed 1,155 Uber rides with an average trip distance of 10.57 miles.
The most common purposes for Uber trips were Meetings, Meal/Entertain, and Errands/Supplies.
Business trips tended to be slightly longer than personal trips, with average durations of 23.24 minutes.
Data Cleaning:
While working with the dataset, I noticed some missing values in critical columns such as START, END, and PURPOSE. To maintain data integrity:

I replaced missing values in these columns with "Unknown", ensuring that no records were lost while also highlighting that this information was unavailable.
Visualization:
The dashboard includes:

Pie Charts showing ride distribution by purpose, start, and end locations.
Bar Charts displaying the count of trips by purpose and location.
Line Chart illustrating the trends in Uber trip purposes throughout the day.
This analysis has been a great learning experience, using Power BI to clean and visualize data effectively. ðŸ“Š

Feel free to check out my analysis in the image below! Would love to hear any feedback or insights from fellow data enthusiasts! ðŸ˜Š
